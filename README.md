World of Warcraft Retail's UI, recreated for Classic. Includes additional features.

### The Repository

All credit goes to the original author [sebast_ian](https://www.curseforge.com/members/sebast_ian).  Community fix pull requests are welcome.

## Addon Settings
Type `/rui`, `/retail`, or `/retailui` to toggle the options menu

## Known Issues
- Sometimes action bars "drop down" and stay misaligned
  - **Workaround:** Happens together with Titan Panel Classic addon. In Titan settings turn off any Bottom Bars and also turn on "Disable Screen Adjust" for bottom bars.
- As a shadow priest, when using Mind Control. The Mind Control bar has bad position in some cases.
